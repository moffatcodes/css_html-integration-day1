		Hey all of you out there, of course reading this blog. I am currently sitting in the school library right now, and this guy seated next to me is really sucking.I dont know who bent the library rules, permiting making zoom meetings. If I am not wrong, it is not allowed to make calls in this reading area. Making zoom calls means that one will be constantly talking, only that this time, he is speaking to a larger number of people which in my honest opinion makes it even worse. The guy has been constantly talking, am not an eavesdropper by the way, but I now know about this Samburu farmer who has to sell his harvest at a lower price than the market price. Persona, I dont know what this persona did. Ha ha, I did not hear this part. Remember, I said I am no eavesdropper. He is not a bad guy though. He greets me on his way out and is a bit of curious if I do code. Not really,I am just a newbie but not particularly a <b>CT</b>as he identifies himself. This is just some basic code, I dont even know why he is surprised.
